## Usage

**Step 1**: Create a post (should be static page so it will not display on blog stream).

**Step 2**: Call app from your theme to load post.

Open your theme file (`default.hbs`, `index.hbs`, `page.hbs`, etc.) depends on what page you want to display the widget, then load widget at where you want with below syntax.

**Syntax**: 

    {{loadpost slug="slug-of-post"}}

For example: If I want to display this widget on All page then I will edit `default.hbs`. If I want to display widget on Homepage then I will edit `index.hbs` or `home.hbs`. 

You can wrap above loading code by a div or an allowed html element - this helps you in styling.

**Example**:

    <div class="widget widget-about">
      {{loadpost slug="slug-of-post"}}
    </div>

Restart Ghost to make sure changes to theme can be applied.
